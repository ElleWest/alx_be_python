# ALX Backend Python - Basic Operations

This repository contains Python exercises and projects for the ALX Backend Development program.

## Python Introduction

### Basic Arithmetic Operations

The `basic_operations.py` script demonstrates fundamental arithmetic operations in Python.

#### Features

- Performs addition, subtraction, and multiplication
- Uses predefined variables (number1 = 10, number2 = 5)
- Displays results in a human-readable format

#### Usage

```bash
python3 basic_operations.py
```

#### Expected Output

```
Addition of 10 and 5 is 15
Subtraction of 10 and 5 is 5
Multiplication of 10 and 5 is 50
```

#### Code Structure

The script follows Python best practices:

- Clear variable assignments
- Explicit arithmetic operations stored in variables
- Clean print statements for output
